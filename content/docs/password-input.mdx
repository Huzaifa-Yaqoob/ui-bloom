<Steps>
<Step>
### Update `global.css`

Add the following CSS to your global or main stylesheet. It is used to **hide the default eye icon** that appears in the native password field, ensuring full control over custom visibility toggles.

<DynamicCodeBlock
  lang={'css'}
  code={`/* hide default eye icon on password field  */
input[type='password']::-ms-reveal,
input[type='password']::-ms-clear,
input[type='password']::-webkit-contacts-auto-fill-button,
input[type='password']::-webkit-credentials-auto-fill-button {
  display: none;
}`}
/>

</Step>
<Step>
### Install

Run this command in your terminal to install the component:

<PackageInstall name={'password-input'} />
</Step>
<Step>
### Import

You can now import this component anywhere you need to use it.

  <DynamicCodeBlock lang={'tsx'} code={`import { PasswordInput } from '@/components/ui/password-input';`}/>
</Step>
<Step>
### Use

Replace the `Input` component with this component inside the `FormField`.

<DynamicCodeBlock
  lang={'tsx'}
  code={`<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="password"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FieldRenderer label="Password">
      <PasswordInput placeholder="password" {...field} />
    </FieldRenderer>
  )}
/>`}
/>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Preview

<PreviewTabs
  component={<PasswordInputForm />}
  code={code}
  name={'password-input'}
/>

## Accepted Props

This component accepts all standard `input` props except for the `type` prop. The type is internally managed by the component to ensure correct functionality (e.g., for password visibility toggling or other controlled behaviors).

## Dependencies

- **Form:** This component relies on the `Form` component from shadcn/ui for proper integration with form handling and submission.
