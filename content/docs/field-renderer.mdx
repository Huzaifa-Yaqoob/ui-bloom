title: 'Field Renderer'
description: 'The Field Renderer component is a reusable wrapper for input fields within a form. It helps reduce repetitive code by abstracting commonly used form field structures into a separate, maintainable component. This promotes cleaner code and improves the overall organization of your form logic.'

## How To Use

Using the Field Renderer component is simple. After installation, import the component and use it within the render function of the FormField component provided by shadcn/ui,<br/>
This helps streamline your form structure by centralizing the rendering logic of form fields into one consistent component.

<Callout title="Usage Restriction">
  This component is designed to be used exclusively within a FormField
  component. It will not function correctly outside of that context.

</Step>
<Step>
### First import this component where you want to use it.

```tsx
import { FieldRenderer } from '@/components/ui/field-renderer';
```

</Step>
<Step>
### And then use it in yourcomponent.

```tsx
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="username"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FieldRenderer label="Username">
      <Input placeholder="username" {...field} />
    </FieldRenderer>
  )}
/>
```

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
  If your form structure and styling remain consistent throughout the project,
  it's recommended to apply your custom styles directly within the Field
  Renderer component itself. This approach eliminates the need to repeatedly
  pass styling props every time you use it, making your code cleaner and more
  maintainable.
</Callout>
