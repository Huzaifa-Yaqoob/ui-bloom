## Benefit

These components are highly useful as they allow you to define and style your typography at once and reuse it consistently throughout your entire project. This approach promotes design consistency and maintainability. Additionally, you can further customize the styles to suit your specific needs.

</Steps>

## Preview

<PreviewTabs
  component={<TypographyView />}
  code={componentCode}
  name={'typography'}
/>

## Accepted Props

These components accept all the standard props relevant to their corresponding HTML elementsâ€”for example, `H1` accepts props for an `<h1>`, H2 for an `<h2>`, `P` for a `<p>`, and Code for a `<code>` element. Additionally, they support the `asChild` prop, allowing you to apply the respective styling without rendering the actual HTML tag. This is useful when you want the styling of a h1 without wrapping your content in an `<h1>` element.
